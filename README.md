# UNUSED CSS FINDER üîçüéõÔ∏è

Web devs are constantly working on websites that just keep growing and changing due to redesigns, new components, etc. And, we eventually end up with a pretty large codebase of styles without knowing if all of them are currently being used. ü§î

## SUGGESTED NODE üìúüì¶

```
node>=v15.14.0
```

## INSTALL

`npm i`

## SET UP THE CRAWLER ‚öôÔ∏èüï∑Ô∏è
1. Create a `settings.json` file on the root with the following attributes:
   - `cssFile` | String: URL to the CSS file to use.
   - `urls` | Array<String>: The URLs to check. You can add an xml sitemap or even a sitemap of sitemaps (Like Yoasts sitemap_index.xml)

2. Run the crawler with `npm run start`

3. Check the results with the ID that is logged in the console. The structure of the result is as follows:
   - status | String
   - urls | Array<String>: The tested URLS.
   - data | Object
     - usedSelectors | Array<Object>: Array of the selectors that are being used in the `urls`. Each selector will also specify the first `url` where it was found.
     - unusedSelectors | Array<String>: Array of the selectors that were not found in the provided `urls`.
